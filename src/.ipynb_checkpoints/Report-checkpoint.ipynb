    "## Introduction and Problem Statement\n",
    "In the present scenario, a plethora of events are being held daily at different places and different times. Hence, it is difficult for a user to keep track of all the events and choose between various events which to attend. The problem worsens because the users do not know which events would be interesting and relevant to them. Hence, it is important that an event sharing social network use recommenders to suggest relevant and interesting events to its users which help them choose between various events. While recommending events, another problem whiich arises is that of unseen data. We do not know for sure which users will attend what events, especially in the case of new users. This is often called the cold start problem. There are many Event Based Social Network (EBSN) websites like meetup.com, eventbrite.com etc., which could deploy this algorithm in order to successfully suggest interesting and relevant events to its users.\n"

    "## Related Work\n",
    "There has been some work done in hybrid approaches in event recommendation by Minkov et al. [1]. This paper demonstrates collaborative filtering on a dataset of academic events. Our implementation of the recommender system follows [2], which also utilizes other signals such as a group of users, location, and temporal preferences. Khrouf and Troncy [3] for recommending music related events, utilized category information about different artists from a well-known source. But this approach fails when we do not have this information about every event, as events can be across different domains. Our implementation takes into account RSVP and group information and other contextual data. Recent works [4] have shown that pure matrix factorization (based only on user-event interactions) performs poorly on EBSN data in comparison to other methods due to a high level of the sparsity of these datasets. As per experiments carried out, state-of-the-art matrix factorization algorithms did not perform better than simple collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based k-NN. Thus the focus is on considering the explicit features than the latent ones. So, we are considering content based features, like, location, time, description of event and group the event belongs to.

    "## Approach & Methods\n",
    "We have built a context-aware, event recommender system, which uses data that collected from meetup.com. We, then, extract the data into python dictionaries. The data we now have is:\n",
    "1. Information of events: description of events, group to which it belongs\n",
    "2. Information of members: description of members (location, id, etc.), events rsvp'd by members\n",
    "3. Information of groups: such as members in the group, events organized by groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "We extracted the data from 1st Jan 2010 to 1st Jan 2014. We then divided the data into timestamps of 6 month each. For example, one timestamp might be 1st July 2010. Then, the first half of the timestamp (Jan 1 - June 30) belongs to training data, and the other half to testing. We use the first half to extract the following features: content of the event, time of the event, location of the event, frequency of the group. "
