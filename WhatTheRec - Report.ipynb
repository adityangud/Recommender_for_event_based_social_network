    "## Introduction and Problem Statement\n",
    "In the present scenario, a plethora of events is being held daily at different places and different times. Hence, it is difficult for a user to keep track of all the events and choose between various events to attend. The problem increases because the users do not know which events would be interesting and relevant to them. Hence, it is important that an event sharing social network uses recommenders to suggest relevant and interesting events to its users which help them choose between various events. While recommending events, another problem that arises is that of unseen data(events). We cannot say, confidently, which users will attend what events, especially in the case of new users. This is called the cold start problem. There are many Event Based Social Network (EBSN) websites like meetup.com, eventbrite.com etc., which could deploy this algorithm in order to successfully suggest interesting and relevant events to its users."

    "## Related Work\n",
    "There has been a lot of work already done including hybrid approaches in event recommendation by Minkov et al. [1]. This paper demonstrates collaborative filtering on a dataset of academic events. Our implementation of the recommender system follows [2], which also utilizes other signals such as a group of users, location, and temporal preferences. Khrouf and Troncy [3] for recommending music related events, utilizes category information about different artists from a well-known source. But this approach fails when we do not have this information about every event, as events can be across different domains. Our implementation takes into account RSVPs, group information and other contextual data. Recent works [4] have shown that pure matrix factorization (based only on user-event interactions) performs poorly on EBSN data in comparison to other methods due to high level of the sparsity of these datasets. As per experiments carried out, state-of-the-art matrix factorization algorithms did not perform better than simple collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based k-NN. Thus, our focus is on considering the explicit features than the latent ones."

    "## Approach & Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Acquisition - Initially we fetched the data from meetup.com using their public APIs. As we started developing, we realized that the data was quite less as it is super sparse in nature. And, when we again started getting data, they changed their APIs and a lot of them were broken. So, we decided to contact the authors of this paper and got the raw data from them. We cleaned and parsed the data and used that for our project. We used data from Jan 1, 2010 - Jan 2014. \n",
    "The data contains following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Events: event id, description of the event, event group, users who RSVP'd this event.\n",
    "2. Members: member id, latitude, longitude\n",
    "3. Groups: events organized by the group, members involved in the group\n",
    "\n",
    "We, then, divided the data into timestamps of 6 months. For example, one timestamp was July 1, 2010. The first 6 months were used for training and the last 6 months for testing. We extracted the following features to recommend events: time, location, description and group frequency of the events. \n",
    "\n",
    "a. Content-based - We formed a model of a user using the description of the past events he/she had attended. Then, we found the similarity of potential events with the user model. \n",
    "\n",
    "b. Location-based - We fit a gaussian distribution to the location of the past events of a user. Then, we found the probability of new event according to the curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "c. Group-Frequency - The intuition here is that the likelihood of the target user attending an event depends on the number of events this user attended in the group that the event belongs to. \n",
    "\n",
    "d. Time-Aware - Another important factor that affects users' decision on attending an event is when the event occurs. We capture this intuition by assuming that users that attended events in the past on certain days of the week and at certain hours of the day will likely attend events with a similar temporal profile in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, that we have built a model of the data, we then computed similarity scores for each member with the events that they had rsvp'd. Events in the first half were used to train the model and the events in the second half were used to test it. Note that we knew the events which the members had rsvp'd for the both the halves. So, the rsvp's for the second half were used to evaluate the model."

Also, location of the event and user has a good significance. However, time and group frequency were found to be less important in classification. One of the main reasons why content feature has the most significance is because description of the event is highly rich and it shows the interest of the user. Location is also making a good impact because it recommends the user events based on the previous events he/she attended. "

    "\n",
    "Further, the next steps would be to use data from other major sites like eventbrite.com, facebook.com and evaluate our recommendation on it. Another work could be to use more features for the system, like: Multi-relational Bayesian personalized ranking. We can also perform learning to rank on our recommender using Rank-SVM or coordinate ascent."
